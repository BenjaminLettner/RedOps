## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality
- Follow C# coding standards and best practices
- Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Use dependency injection for better testability
- Document all public APIs and components

### Security
- Never include real exploits in the main codebase
- Implement proper input validation
- Add warning messages for potentially dangerous operations
- Include rate limiting where appropriate

### Documentation
- Maintain up-to-date API documentation
- Include usage examples
- Create user guides
- Document deployment procedures

## Future Enhancements

### Technical Features
- Plugin architecture for extending functionality
- Cloud integration (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Containerization support (Docker)
- API for automation

### User Experience
- Web-based GUI
- Team collaboration features
- Mobile companion app
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines

### Integrations
- SIEM integration (Splunk, ELK, etc.)
- Vulnerability scanners (Nessus, OpenVAS)
- Frameworks (Metasploit, Cobalt Strike)
- Cloud security tools
